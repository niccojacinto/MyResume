  <Dialogue id="R-phone" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="pxArt-mobileicon" image_pos="">That's my mobile phone number. I'd very much prefer to be emailed though!

  </Dialogue>

  <Dialogue id="R-loc2" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">Okay, that's not really where I live. It's classified.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-soq_csharp" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="" image_pos="">Most of my projects, both professional and hobby ones are done in C#, so I'm most comfortable with that language.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-soq_mechanics" speaker="Nicco" next_id="R-soq_mechanics2" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">I've protoyped a lot of mechanics I wanted to just 'try' out.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-soq_mechanics2" speaker="Nicco" next_id="R-soq_mechanics3" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">Sometimes they're part of a project, but most of the time they're not so I don't really save them.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-soq_mechanics3" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">Like.. there's this rubixcube-like meets tetris inventory style system I was playing around with for VR. It was quite fun to make. :D</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-soq_entrylvl" speaker="Nicco" next_id="R-soq_entrylvl2" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">I think I've reached the point where I want to work on projects on a slightly bigger scale. I believe I can start working on a project and learn from it since I am a blank slate and still have much to learn.
    <Response next_id="R-soq_entrylvl2" text="Are you open to other roles besides programming?"></Response>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-soq_entrylvl2" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">Yep. Like I said, I have much to learn from across different fields so I'm open to other roles as well.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-soq_languages" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">C# is my preferred language, but I've also dabbled around other languages depending on the situation. It may take me a while to review and re-learn the language in question though.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-soq_problemsolving" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">Solving issues just comes with the job. Off by one errors, Heisenbugs (LOL), order of execution errors, design flaws.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-soq_collab" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">While flying solo certainly is fun and liberating in its own way. I'm certain working with various and more experienced talents would shift the fun in a different way!</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-soq_upskilling" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">Eventually, I do want more experience working around Networking, exploring AI integration in games, more VR/AR applications, and last but not least.. procedural generation concepts.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-ts" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">Pretty straightforward here... you can see tools I've used, but didn't necessarily include a lot of detail. For example.. I mostly use Linux Mint for just powering my slowly dying laptop that I rarely use.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-educ_npower" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="pxArt-npower" image_pos="">Might seem weird having this, but I did take a slight interest in data. Also from what I've learned, there can be game applications from it, and it does involve some degree of programming using Python for example.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-educ_googleit" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">This is my I.T. bit. It's very fundamental, but it did give me a small glimpse of the IT world. I was also reading Michel Meyer's CompTIA on the side (although never actually took the certification) and there was a LOT of information there I wouldn't have normally come across.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-educ_humber" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="pxArt-humber" image_pos="">I took game programming courses in Humber. I was quite stressful but also fun! Shoutout to Kris Alexander! (definitely a passionate guy when it comes to games)</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-exp_acid" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="pxArt-acid" image_pos="">I worked on several acid projects...

  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-acidgp" speaker="Nicco" next_id="R-acidgp2" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">GoPhysio was basically software installed on a 3D camera that general practitioners would use to monitor a patient's exercise routine...</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-acidgp2" speaker="Nicco" next_id="R-exp_acid" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">I worked on product execution flow, importing assets, maintenance, device API, and UI.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-acidcvrep" speaker="Nicco" next_id="R-acidcvrep2" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">CVRep was a remote controlled donor wall project.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-acidcvrep2" speaker="Nicco" next_id="R-exp_acid" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">I worked on the entire screen display and remote software along with the mobile API to front-end.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-acidpenn" speaker="Nicco" next_id="R-acidpenn2" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">Penn was a donor wall project that went on Penn Highlands Healthcare.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-acidpenn2" speaker="Nicco" next_id="R-exp_acid" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">I mostly worked on UI on a seriously short timeframe.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-acidother" speaker="Nicco" next_id="R-exp_acid" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">I did do other small interactive game projects that were there, but never really the focus of the company.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-viral" speaker="Nicco" next_id="R-viral2" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">My main responsibilities in ViRal were machine maintenance and customer onboarding and assistance...</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-viral2" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">I was also either manning the front desk or creating software to be used with the VR machines during downtime.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-portfolio" speaker="Nicco" next_id="portfolio2" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">You can view my portfolio &lt;color=#00ffffff&gt;&lt;link=https://niccojacinto.wixsite.com/divinyx&gt;[ here ]&lt;/link&gt;&lt;/color&gt;
    <Response next_id="R-portfoliomadload" text="Your projects page isn't loading, maybe you should fix that.."></Response>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-portfoliomadload" speaker="Nicco" next_id="R-portfoliomadload2" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">I'm terribly sorry... I can guarantee that the page is fine as I've asked multiple people to try it out, it just does take a WHILE..</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-portfoliomadload2" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">I'm still debating whether to optimize each individual media I've used in the site or whether to just make a simpler portolio site altogether.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-projects" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">If you haven't yet... please visit my portfolio &lt;color=#00ffffff&gt;&lt;link=https://niccojacinto.wixsite.com/divinyx&gt;[ here ]&lt;/link&gt;&lt;/color&gt;
    <Response next_id="R-portfoliomadload" text="Your projects page isn't loading, maybe you should fix that.."></Response>
  </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-volunteer" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">I was into film and photography during the early days of Youtube so I volunteered for this company. I mostly did technical maintenance, handling equipment, and managing camera and sound.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-Qwhyanswer" speaker="Nicco" next_id="R-Qwhyanswer2" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">The intent on certain responses were not to be detail heavy, but more or less conversational...</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-Qwhyanswer2" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">so in that sense, it's not actually meant to be a substitute for an actual interview nor an actual interactive resume made in javascript.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-Qpurpose" speaker="Nicco" next_id="R-Qpurpose2" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">I was in the middle of doing another iteration on my Resume when I came across an interactive javascript resume online..</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-Qpurpose2" speaker="Nicco" next_id="R-Qpurpose3" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">It was interesting, but me having the attention span of a goldfish (no offense to all the goldfish out there) sometimes can't get through blocks of added text on top of the actual resume.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-Qpurpose3" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">So my main motivation was just to do my own take on it, while giving the reader a bit more incentive to keep reading.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-Qfav" speaker="Nicco" next_id="R-Qfav2" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">It's really difficult to pick 'The One Game To Rule Them All', but since I get casually asked this question quite a bit so I always defaulted to.. </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-Qfav2" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">"Suikoden II", which was the FFVII of my childhood</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-Qgametype" speaker="Nicco" next_id="R-Qgametype2" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">I play a variety of games, so it might be better to say what I tend to avoid or outright don't enjoy.. </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-Qgametype2" speaker="Nicco" next_id="R-Qgametype3" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">.. which would probably be Horror Games, Party Games, and/or Extremely Skill Dependent Games. </Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-Qgametype3" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">That being said, I still appreciate the ingenuity in their programming and design, and I would watch people play them from time to time instead.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-Qsched" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">In theory, I am quite flexible in my schedules, but like all things, it will depend on the circumstances and restrictions.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-Qtimemachine" speaker="Nicco" next_id="R-Qtimemachine2" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">The Past. Is it because I dwell on my mistakes? It's part of it.. yes, but going into the future doesn't really bring anything to the table.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-Qtimemachine2" speaker="Nicco" next_id="R-Qtimemachine3" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">if you just want a glimpse, sure, but travel? If you think about it, we are currently living in the future of people from the past,</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-Qtimemachine3" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">and living now doesn't seem any different from traveling to the future. Whereas traveling to the past opens up countless possibilities.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-Qworkmoney" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">Isn't that the dream? Just pick a career that aligns with your hobbies, or manage people instead, or teach, or pick up something that let's you build and create.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-Qcomms" speaker="Nicco" next_id="R-Qcomms2" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">In a perfect world people wouldn't need to communicate at all...</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-Qcomms2" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait2" image_pos="">I'd describe it more like Mental Omnipotence as opposed to SSS Tier Mind Reading.</Dialogue>
