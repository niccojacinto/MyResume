  <Dialogue id="introduction1" speaker="You" next_id="introduction2" image_id="" image_pos="">Hello, welcome, its good to see that you could make it, have a seat.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="introduction2" speaker="???" next_id="introduction3" image_id="portrait" image_pos="">Thank you, it's good to be here.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="introduction3" speaker="You" next_id="introduction4" image_id="" image_pos="">So let's get this started shall we?</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="introduction4" speaker="You" next_id="introduction5" image_id="" image_pos="">Can I call you "Niccolo"?</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="introduction5" speaker="Nicco" next_id="introduction6" image_id="portrait" image_pos="">A lot of people call me "Nicco", since it's way easier to say. Haha!</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="introduction6" speaker="You" next_id="introduction7" image_id="" image_pos="">Haha! Alright, alright.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="introduction7" speaker="You" next_id="[TUTORIAL]" image_id="" image_pos="">So Nicco, let's talk about your resume...</Dialogue>

  <Dialogue id="R-nicco" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait" image_pos="">Yep, that's me. People also call me Nix.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-phone" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait" image_pos="">That's my mobile phone number. I'd very much prefer to be emailed though!<Response next_id="R-phone2" text="Can I leave you text messages then?"></Response></Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-phone2" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait" image_pos="">Absolutely! the reception's just real bad over where I'm at. Leaving a voicemail is also good if you're unable to reach me!</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-linkedin" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="" image_pos="">You can view my LinkedIn profile here if you want: &lt;color=lightblue&gt;&lt;link=https://www.linkedin.com/in/niccojacinto&gt;MyLinkedIn&lt;/link&gt;&lt;/color&gt;</Dialogue>

  <Dialogue id="R-loc" speaker="Nicco" next_id="R-loc2" image_id="portrait" image_pos="">Visit me here: &lt;color=lightblue&gt;&lt;link=https://goo.gl/maps/NV693kDWnFPob98X7&gt;Location&lt;/link&gt;&lt;/color&gt;</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-loc2" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait" image_pos="">Okay, that's not really where I live. It's classified.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-soq_csharp" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="" image_pos="">Most of my projects, both professional and hobby ones are done in C#, so I'm most comfortable with that language.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-soq_mechanics" speaker="Nicco" next_id="R-soq_mechanics2" image_id="portrait" image_pos="">I've protoyped a lot of mechanics I wanted to just 'try' out.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-soq_mechanics2" speaker="Nicco" next_id="R-soq_mechanics3" image_id="portrait" image_pos="">Sometimes they're part of a project, but most of the time they're not so I don't really save them.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-soq_mechanics3" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait" image_pos="">Like.. there's this rubixcube-like meets tetris inventory style system I was playing around with for VR. It was quite fun to make. :D</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-soq_entrylvl" speaker="Nicco" next_id="R-soq_entrylvl2" image_id="portrait" image_pos="">I think I've reached the point where I want to work on projects on a slightly bigger scale. I believe I can start working on a project and learn from it since I am a blank slate and still have much to learn.<Response next_id="R-soq_entrylvl3" text="Are you open to other roles besides programming?"></Response></Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-soq_entrylvl3" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait" image_pos="">Yep. Like I said, I have much to learn from across different fields so I'm open to other roles as well.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-soq_languages" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait" image_pos="">C# is my preferred language, but I've also dabbled around other languages depending on the situation. It may take me a while to review and re-learn the language in question though.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-soq_problemsolving" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait" image_pos="">Solving issues just comes with the job. Off by one errors, Heisenbugs (LOL), order of execution errors, design flaws.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-soq_collab" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait" image_pos="">While flying solo certainly is fun and liberating in its own way. I'm certain working with various and more experienced talents would shift the fun in a different way!</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-soq_upskilling" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait" image_pos="">Eventually, I do want more experience working around Networking, exploring AI integration in games, more VR/AR applications, and last but not least.. procedural generation concepts.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-ts" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait" image_pos="">Pretty straightforward here... you can see tools I've used, but didn't necessarily include a lot of detail. For example.. I mostly use Linux Mint for just powering my slowly dying laptop that I rarely use.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-educ_npower" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait" image_pos="">Might seem weird having this, but I did take a slight interest in data. Also from what I've learned, there can be game applications from it, and it does involve some degree of programming using Python for example.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-educ_googleit" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait" image_pos="">This is my I.T. bit. It's very fundamental, but it did give me a small glimpse of the IT world. I was also reading Michel Meyer's CompTIA on the side (although never actually took the certification) and there was a LOT of information there I wouldn't have normally come across.</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-educ_humber" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait" image_pos="">I took game programming courses in Humber. I was quite stressful but also fun! Shoutout to Kris Alexander! (definitely a passionate guy when it comes to games)</Dialogue>
  <Dialogue id="R-exp_acid" speaker="Nicco" next_id="" image_id="portrait" image_pos="">::Under Construction::</Dialogue>
