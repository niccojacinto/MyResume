# MyResume

My take on an interactive resume using UnityEngine since I didn't really like the interactive
javascript resumes I mostly see online, plus I'll have to learn it, I'd rather make a really simple
'game'-like Resume that I'd eventually put in hopefully GitPages, if I can keep the file size low enough.

Additionally, I can also use it within a portfolio so why not. My portfolio site isn't really working out I think
so this might add a bit of oompf when viewing my profile.
